\title{Compare RDS files using diffobj for better snapshot review}
\usage{
compare_file_object(old, new)
}
\arguments{
\item{old}{Path to the old (reference) RDS file}

\item{new}{Path to the new RDS file to compare}
}
\value{
\link{logical} TRUE if objects are identical, FALSE otherwise
}
\description{
This comparison function loads RDS files and compares the deserialized
R objects rather than raw bytes. This enables better visualization in
snapshot_review() by comparing the actual object structure rather than
binary serialization.

For meaningful diffs in testthat's snapshot_review(), which uses diffobj
internally, this function compares the R objects after deserialization.
