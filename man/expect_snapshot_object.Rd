\usage{
expect_snapshot_object(x, style = "json2", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An R object to snapshot. Can be any R object including lists,
models, data.frames, vectors, etc.}

\item{style}{\link{character} Serialization style. One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"json"} - Uses \code{jsonlite::toJSON} for readable output (simple objects only)
\item \code{"json2"} - Uses \code{jsonlite::serializeJSON} for more complex objects (default)
\item \code{"deparse"} - Uses R's \code{deparse()} for R code representation
\item \code{"serialize"} - Uses raw byte serialization (works for any object but not human-readable)
}}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[testthat:expect_snapshot_value]{testthat::expect_snapshot_value}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{cran}}{Should these expectations be verified on CRAN? By default,
they are not, because snapshot tests tend to be fragile because they
often rely on minor details of dependencies.}
    \item{\code{tolerance}}{Numerical tolerance: any differences smaller than this
value will be ignored.

The default tolerance is \code{sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)}, unless long doubles
are not available, in which case the test is skipped.}
    \item{\code{variant}}{If not-\code{NULL}, results will be saved in
\verb{_snaps/\{variant\}/\{test\}/\{name\}}. This allows you to create variants for
experiments, or if the results are different on different operating
systems. Snapshot variant is set by the
\link[testthat:local_reproducible_output]{local_reproducible_output()} function and its friends. If you're developing
a package you can set it in the \code{tests/testthat/helper.R} file.}

Invisible \code{NULL} (from \code{\link[testthat:expect_snapshot_value]{testthat::expect_snapshot_value()}})
}
\description{
A flexible wrapper around \code{\link[testthat:expect_snapshot_value]{testthat::expect_snapshot_value()}} that allows
snapshotting any R object, not just data.frames. This function provides
a convenient interface for snapshot testing with sensible defaults for
serialization style.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Snapshot a list
expect_snapshot_object(list(a = 1, b = 2, c = "text"))

# Snapshot a model
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
expect_snapshot_object(model, style = "serialize")

# Snapshot a data.frame with JSON style
expect_snapshot_object(iris[1:5, ], style = "json")
