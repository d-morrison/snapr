\title{Get platform variant including OS and R version}
\usage{
platform_variant()
}
\value{
A character string like "linux-4.4", "darwin-4.5", or
"windows-4.4"
}
\description{
Returns a variant string combining OS and R major.minor version.
This is useful for RDS snapshots that vary by both platform and R version.
}
\details{
RDS files can produce different binary output across R versions even when
using the same serialization version. This function creates variant strings
like "linux-4.4", "darwin-4.5", "windows-4.4" to handle these differences.

Use this function with \code{\link[testthat:expect_snapshot_file]{testthat::expect_snapshot_file()}} when testing
RDS files or other formats that vary by both OS and R version.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Use with expect_snapshot_file for RDS snapshots
expect_snapshot_object(
  my_object, name = "test", variant = platform_variant()
)
}
