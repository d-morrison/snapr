\title{Get the current operating system}
\usage{
system_os()
}
\value{
A character string: "linux", "darwin" (macOS), or "windows"
}
\description{
Returns the name of the current operating system in lowercase.
This is a simple wrapper around \code{Sys.info()[["sysname"]]}.
}
\details{
This function is used with testthat's \code{variant} parameter in
\code{\link[testthat:expect_snapshot_file]{testthat::expect_snapshot_file()}} to create OS-specific snapshots
when file formats produce different output across platforms.

Common use cases:
\itemize{
\item RDS files: Binary serialization format that can differ across OS
\item Platform-specific numeric computations (e.g., MCMC algorithms)
\item Files with platform-specific line endings or encodings
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Use with expect_snapshot_file for OS-specific snapshots
expect_snapshot_object(my_object, name = "test", variant = system_os())
}
}
